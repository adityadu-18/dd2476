difficult cases
1. what i wish i knew...
this page is too general for collecting useful informations for mathematics as graduate program, hence i considered rate this page as level 1. however, take into consideration the generality this page could provide, those who wants a brief view of the whole program in the campus may get some additional informations. therefore i finally rated this page as level 2.
2. economics
economics are highly relevant to the field of mathematics, however this page contains only undergraduate program relating to the major of economics. therefore i rated this page as level 1.
3. computer science
this field also requires highly intensive mathemtaics skill, for example, probablistics, discrete mathematics, and so on. however, this page are barely relevant to the graduate program. hence i rated this page as level 1.

precision: 16/18=0.8889
recall: 16/100
the best precision rate and recall among those queries.
moreover, the most relevant pages 'mathematics', 'economics' and 'statistics' are listed in the results.
hence i consider this query the optimal.
